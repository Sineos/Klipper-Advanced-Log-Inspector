# Klipper Advanced Log Inspector

A browser-based GUI for advanced inspection, comparison, and diagnosis of Klipper 3D printer log files. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to quickly parse `klippy.log` files and analyze critical information about shutdowns without using the command line.

The core parsing logic of this application is a JavaScript port inspired by the official `logextract.py` script provided by the Klipper project. You can find the original script here: https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/scripts/logextract.py
